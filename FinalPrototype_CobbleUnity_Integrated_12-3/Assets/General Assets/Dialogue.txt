Cobble, you're alive!  Can you hear me?
I'm Alani, I'm the one who built you.
Lets get you out of there.  There is a gate over there but the control panel on this side is broken.
You'll have to open it from your side.
Grab that battery and take it to the control panel to power it on.

Test. Hey Cobble!  This is the test area.
Try picking up that object.
This is line number three!

Skip a line test.
Blah blah blah.

This is the Fuel Depot!  Look out for the acid.  There's acid explosions and pools.
Find the fuel processor and get us some fuel!

This will be our home base where we build our rocket.  Bring all the parts you find back here.
Go to the fuel depot first and get us some power!

Hey, looks like this gate is controlled by that pressure plate.
To keep it open you'll have to find something heavy to push onto it.

Great Job!  Come meet me at my base.  Go through the big gate up ahead.
